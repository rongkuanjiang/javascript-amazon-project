unfinished but finishing wouldn't be the best use of my time. I should consolidate the skills that I would've consolidated by finishing this project by learning more things and building something more integrated.

to implement:
* add to cart green checkmark popup
* add to cart >1 quantity 
* update button in the checkout page
* interactive checkout number of items
* interactive order page

not sure how to implement:
* search functionality
